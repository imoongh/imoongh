# 👋 Hi, I'm Imoongh

I'm a **Senior Scientist** (Electrochemist) and a passionate **Python developer**. My daily work includes creating solutions to extract, combine, analyse, and visualise experimental data, making the process quick, efficient and standardized for my colleagues.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Data extraction, analysis & visualization: making a bridge between what's possible with the software that comes with lab equipment and what users of that equipment really need 
- Efficiency improvements & workflow standardization
- Machine Learning: sklearn, tensorflow, keras

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

I'm currently building a portfolio of data science projects, but this is still a work and progress and I have it all as private for now. Willing to share in specific cases, but will only make these public when I'm happier with them. I'm working on:
  - Projects from a recent data science course. 
  - Public battery / energy storage datasets: EDA, data engineering, extracting meaningful insights.
  - Huckleberry data: predicting sleep patterns from historic data.

## 📈 Latest Project

Currently, I'm working on 2 new projects:
*  **energy storage devices**: find public dataset, preferably including electrochemical and other characterisation data, extract as much meaningful information as possible.
*  explore using **Huckleberry** data to predict sleep schedules (IYKYK!) 💤
